X *) Mysql Seems to have UUID stored as binary so maybe we need to address that in inserts for autoincrement

XX *) new @View annotation
   makes no sense. User can create their own rowmapper since we 
   wont allow any modifications to view
X *) insert generated key test for UUID.
XX *) sqlcolumn should take table and column prefix.
     No point because we wont be able to map properties to beanRowMapper
X *) More tests for merge hasOne hasMany
X *) More tests for findByProperty
X *) dont show error if catalog is used for oracle or schema is used for    
     catalog.schema.table
     schema.table
     table
     catalog without schema say invalid

X *) SimpleInsert lets add type. Took it out since SimpleJdbcInsert already does it.
X *) fix for merge hasMany so order is retained.
X *) hook for customconverterservice
X *) Need to know database type for insertWithSynonms
X *) BeanPropertyRowMapper method to include conversionservice
X *) findbyProperty cache key should include property name
X *) UUID support (Done for postgres)
